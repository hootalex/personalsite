        <p>Right now I'm on spring break. (yay!) Which means I'm back in Scranton for the week. And since the NPR intern position didn't quite pan out, it's a precursor to my summer as well. I like NEPA, I really do enjoy it. Scranton included. I had to drive my sister 3 hours to her college just to have the car for the break. It's so sad how much of a necessity a vehicle is. If for any reason you have to go to the Old Country Buffet (RIP) in Dickson City- without a vehicle you'd have to walk on the highway to get there. And we've all silently judged people who we see walking on the highway so obviously you don't want to be the person who's subject to that mental anguish of knowing that they're being judged by the guy in the black Neon with the Monster energy decals (nevermind that's a bad example) Anyways, I guess maybe driving isn't that much of a big deal. It's just that it seemed like I never needed to drive to find interesting things, and then once I started driving my standard for interesting places changed. So not only does the act increase my chances of dying by 2000%, but it's also made me less interesting. But so have a lot of things. I'm really looking forward to my crits when school starts next week. Everyone will get to see my new hair. (Remember, you shaved it because you got bored.) I guess I got a little depressed because my one of my favorite podcasters had a mental breakdown on Twitter. It really hurts to see someone who always seemed so thoughtful and composed break down in front of you, even if it's only in 140 character-limited bursts. Because secretly we (I) rely on these people for our own sanity and composure. It's funny though, you never know where those mental tics end and where the person begins. Especially when all you know them through is a disembodied voice and a Twitter icon. I don't think less of him. It was weird though. Anyways, this spring break is going nicely. Meeting up with some friends, having fun with projectors, trying to find a summer job. The last pic, the air smelled so nice. I'm having awful asthmatic reactions to my pets at home as usual. My inhaler started at like 100 puffs and it's already down to 0.</p>
