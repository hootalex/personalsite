    <h1>hear to there</h1>
    <h2>2018</h2> A website that allows you to travel to places through field recordings and voice memos. Think of it like a train where each stop is an audio recording closer to your destination.

    <h1>Homesick Projections</h1>
    <h2>Summer 2016&ndash;onward</h2> Roadside projections of where people are feeling homesick. (The locations are found automatically through social networks.) Projected on a road trip from my hometown in Scranton, Pennsylvania to locations around the country. (More info and photos soon)

    <h1>Juneau</h1>
    <h2>2015</h2> A simple website where a person types in their name and their phone whispers it back to them. The whisper is my own voice and hundreds of names have been recorded. A pulsating red light flashes across the phone screen while a script runs to keep
    the phone awake until it dies or the website is closed. I had a demo in class where everyone's phones were placed in plastic bags hanging from the walls and it looked very nice and embryonic in the dark. I hope to tweak this and use this with large
    groups of people in the future.
