  <h1>Info Stands</h1>
  <h2>2015-?</h2> These two plywood info stands were constructed during my first year at Cooper. They originally talked to each other as if they were in a dark room and couldn't find the other one. They've been through several different paint jobs and have since toured together and individually with different original audio programs depending on their location.
