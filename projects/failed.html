    <h1>Pineapple Project</h1>
    <h2>2014</h2> My response to professor Doug Ashford's famous prompt. Basically "move a pineapple off of a shelf without touching it". I held a poll to determine the existence of the pineapple where I had planned for other students show up to outnumber and outvote my class, it was close but in the end the vote determined that there was no pineapple.<br><br>There were many presentational issues with the project. Footage exists somewhere... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fir0002">Photo by Fir0002 until I can find a photo from the crit</a>

  <h1>Info Stands</h1>
  <h2>2015-?</h2> These two plywood info stands were constructed during my first year at Cooper. They originally talked to each other as if they were in a dark room and couldn't find the other one. They've been through several different paint jobs and have since toured together and individually with different original audio programs depending on their location.
