    <h1>The Cooper Union <br>Intra-Disciplinary Seminar</h1>
    <h2>2017</h2> Founded in 1997, The Cooper Union Intra-Disciplinary Seminar is a public lecture series that invites artists, theorists, activists, designers, writers, curators, and more to discuss their practice. I created a logo and a poster for the Fall 2017 lecture series.

    <h1>Nicholson Typeface</h1>
    <h2>2017</h2> A serif typeface that began in Hannes Famira's semester-long Type Design course at The Cooper Union. It is still far from complete, but you can try it out at the link below.

    <h1>Juneau</h1>
    <h2>2015</h2> A simple website where a person types in their name and their phone whispers it back to them. The whisper is my own voice and hundreds of names have been recorded. A pulsating red light flashes across the phone screen while a script runs to keep
    the phone awake until it dies or the website is closed. I had a demo in class where everyone's phones were placed in plastic bags hanging from the walls and it looked very nice and embryonic in the dark. I hope to tweak this and use this with large
    groups of people in the future.
