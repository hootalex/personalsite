There's this old lady I see on the railroad tracks
from time to time and one day she told me the story
of when she saw a huge blue and green bird down the
tracks- she thought she was going crazy but it turned
out her neighbor had gotten himself a pet peacock.
He let it roam around with the wild turkeys and they
would go to the tracks to eat the grain that fell off
the cars. One day she discovered the peacock had got
itself run over. She plucked some feathers for herself
and went to tell her neighbor who buried his pet in
his backyard.
