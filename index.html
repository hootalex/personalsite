  <p>I am an artist going to school at Cooper Union in New York City. This site isn't my <a href="http://alextomlinson.info">portfolio</a>, but more of a small personal page where I can share my thoughts, links, and works-in-progress. My interests include but are not limited to: <i>Photography, Hiking, Music, Typography & Design, Philosophy (Podcasts), Contemporary Art, Technology, and more.<br>Also &frac12; of the band Secretary Desk.</i></p>

  <p>So right now I'm working on my first project with concrete! I had no idea how insanely cheap the stuff was and the idea of how permanent it could be is really seductive to me. I read something online somewhere that said when you tell people your plans for something you're less likely to finish them- so I won't go into too much detail for fear of that happening. (I know it's a real thing, trust me.) Let's just say it involves arch-shaped things, a secret location, and did I mention there were lots of these arch-shaped things? Apologies to my studiomates for smashing concrete on the floor and the mess in the sink. I'm not completely responsible for the sink though- <em>@Richard</em>.
    <br>
    Also! You may have noticed that this site has changed. Might be a little messy- still getting stuff situated.
