    <p>Some pictures from this summer so far<br>
    <i>(numbered from left to right &#8594;)</i></p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>What to name this one?</li>
      <li>Take 2! Like this one much better. (To see how ridiculous the old one was, just remove "2" from the web address)</li>
      <li><i>UFO</i></li>
      <li><i>My Poor Ass</i></li>
      <li><s>This is really just a palate cleanser, maybe even a placeholder. The other pictures just really want something that looks like this. Compositionally sort of looks like the first one. Definitely not above bookending things. Just worried it looks like a stock photo. Worst nightmare. (Unless that becomes interesting for me) Will work more on something like this.</s> Just guess what it was ;)</li>
