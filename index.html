<h1>July 10, 2016</h1>
As I was walking along the tracks I was surprised to find myself in someone's backyard. I was greeted by one of their many cats napping and roaming around the lawn. Mostly running away from me. I tried to take some pictures, the property was so nice. I'm not sure you can legally build that close to a railroad anymore. Although there were lights on, and the shutter of my camera was loud I took like 20 pictures anyways. None of them came out all that well unfortunately.
