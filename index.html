  <h1>Alex Tomlinson</h1>
    <p>Some pictures from this summer so far<br>
    <i>(numbered from left to right &#8594;)</i></p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Yes, but 2 and 3 need to speak more with this.</li>
      <li>Would like to re-take this. Miscalculated the exposure so there's a bit of sneaky but unpleasant noise. I think the composition could change too.</li>
      <li>I like this, but I think it could also be better.</li>
      <li>I'm very happy with this. Though I'd like to take similar-themed photos to give it a little bit more of a story. Kind of funny with the antenna.</li>
